This is the long form of my resumé, with more details than you would usually get if I sent you an email. You might want to sit down, it may take a while.

Let's start with my work history in reverse chronological order, followed by my education and finally my interests and hobbies.

### Full-stack developer for a stock planning system for AMBEV

**What does that mean?**

I am responsible for both front-end and back-end development together with a team of back-end developers working on a system for AMBEV used for inventory distribution.

Our team uses SCRUM to plan and develop the system, and part of my responsibilities is to refactor the front-end code so it follows best practices, as well as begin building automated tests for the front-end.

`We use an Angular, C# and SQL stack in this project.`

### Full-stack developer for a product delivery system for UNILEVER

**What does that mean?**

I was responsible for both front-end and back-end development together with a team of back-end developers working on a system for UNILEVER used by their teams in the field to control their deliveries.

Our team attempted to use SCRUM for our internal processes, though the team on UNILEVER did not, with mixed success.

The transition from the project I worked on before was done completely remotely, including forming a new team and learning new technologies.

`We used a stack of Ionic, Angular, Java, PHP, C# and SQL`

### Full-stack developer for a product delivery planning system for AMBEV

**What does that mean?**

Simply put, I was responsible for both front-end and back-end development along with a team of back-end developers working on the award winning system we developed for AMBEV that helps them be industry leaders in order fulfillment in the beverage industry.

Our team used SCRUM to plan and develop the system, and part of my responsibility was prototyping with low and high fidelity (I was chosen for this due to my design background), keeping usability in mind as well as raise any issues the users might have in using our product.

During my time in this project I trained two interns to work on the front-end as well, including the person who took over when I changed projects. I was also responsible for making sure the code followed our design patterns and quality.

I did this while I was an intern, and continued to do so after I got hired, until I changed projects. During 2020 we worked from home as a remote team, to great success.

`We use an Angular, C# and SQL stack in this project.`

### Founded afelipeor Design

```
07-08-2016 - 12-03-2018
```

Using my previous experience I started my own web-design agency, focused on UI development. I'd both create the designs as well as implement them according to the specifications of the clients.

While I did do some php work, our focus was mostly HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. We did not offer full-stack development, and specialized in website redesigns bringing older websites new life with new interactivity and following the cutting edge of best practices following the boom of UX studies.

During this time I learnt a lot about management, marketing and how to help your clients discover what they really need rather than what they think they want.

In a few cases we teemed up with freelancers to be able to offer a bigger service package to varying degrees of success. Learning how to find someone you can trust to get the job done as well as fit the client's style was a very important part of the process.

I shut the agency down in 2018 due to health problems that led to severe burnout, even though we were really starting to gain traction in the market.

Health is always priority number one.

### Internship at TIVIT

```
07-08-2015 - 07-08-2016
```

Front-end developer for a B2B route planning and vehicle tracking system. I worked on the transition from php and AngularJs to Angular 2, in an effort to update the legacy code the project contained.

`We used Angular, AngularJs and PHP`

### Started André Felipe Arts

```
01-01-2013 - 01-12-2013
```

This was my first attempt at running a business. I took what I had learned while running the day to day design side at PrintLabor and decided to make it work for myself.

It was the first time I seriously considered being an entrepreneur, and began to learn what it took to be one.

This business was focused on graphic design and was very much a learning experience. While the graphic design part was doing ok, relying on the experience and connections I had made during my time at PrintLabor giving me a head start, I decided to pivot to web design, as it was what I felt most passionately about.

While I don't think it was the wrong move to make, I was in no way prepared for what changing to web truly meant. My inexperience in the business led to me not fully understanding what I had to offer in order to really provide value to my clients. And so the packages I offered were lack-luster, even if I was priced considerably under market value.

I learnt a lot about the market I wanted to operate in during this time, and felt it best to close up shop and focus on really learning the skills and understanding what the market really needed before launching myself again.

### Designer at PrintLabor

```
15-02-2011 - 15-12-2011
```

PrintLabor was a graphic-design agency in Rio de Janeiro. I helped open the second location and worked as lead designer, responsible for creating and approving the clients designs before they went to print. I also enabled them to offer web-design services as well, and was responsible for creating and implementing the designs.

### Internship at Broto Cultural

```
15-01-2010 - 15-12-2010
```

Internship at Broto Cultural, where I was responsible for creating marketing content as maintaining the website.

This is when I decided that eb was what I wanted to get into, and paved the way for the rest.

## Freelancing

Beyond traditional employment and starting businesses I've worked as a freelancer in several different disciplines.

I will not list the different companies I have worked for as a freelancer, as there would be no merit to that, but I will list the different disciplines and the services I've offered through them.

### Branding services:

Through the years I've specialized in offering branding packs, complete with logos, business cards, design systems, and if required, website design mockups.

### Interpreting

I've worked for years doing english-portuguese/portuguese-english interpreting for meetings, courses and other functions, both in person and online.
