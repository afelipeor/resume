### Full-stack developer for a stock planning system for AMBEV

**What does that mean?**

I am responsible for both front-end and back-end development together with a team of back-end developers working on a system for AMBEV used for inventory distribution.

Our team uses SCRUM to plan and develop the system, and part of my responsibilities is to refactor the front-end code so it follows best practices, as well as begin building automated tests for the front-end.

`We use an Angular, C# and SQL stack in this project.`

### Full-stack developer for a product delivery system for UNILEVER

**What does that mean?**

I was responsible for both front-end and back-end development together with a team of back-end developers working on a system for UNILEVER used by their teams in the field to control their deliveries.

Our team attempted to use SCRUM for our internal processes, though the team on UNILEVER did not, with mixed success.

The transition from the project I worked on before was done completely remotely, including forming a new team and learning new technologies.

`We used a stack of Ionic, Angular, Java, PHP, C# and SQL`

### Full-stack developer for a product delivery planning system for AMBEV

**What does that mean?**

Simply put, I was responsible for both front-end and back-end development along with a team of back-end developers working on the award winning system we developed for AMBEV that helps them be industry leaders in order fulfillment in the beverage industry.

Our team used SCRUM to plan and develop the system, and part of my responsibility was prototyping with low and high fidelity (I was chosen for this due to my design background), keeping usability in mind as well as raise any issues the users might have in using our product.

During my time in this project I trained two interns to work on the front-end as well, including the person who took over when I changed projects. I was also responsible for making sure the code followed our design patterns and quality.

I did this while I was an intern, and continued to do so after I got hired, until I changed projects. During 2020 we worked from home as a remote team, to great success.

`We use an Angular, C# and SQL stack in this project.`

### Founded afelipeor Design

```
07-08-2016 - 12-03-2018
```

Using my previous experience I started my own web-design agency, focused on UI development. I'd both create the designs as well as implement them according to the specifications of the clients.

While I did do some php work, our focus was mostly HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. We did not offer full-stack development, and specialized in website redesigns bringing older websites new life with new interactivity and following the cutting edge of best practices following the boom of UX studies.

During this time I learnt a lot about management, marketing and how to help your clients discover what they really need rather than what they think they want.

In a few cases we teemed up with freelancers to be able to offer a bigger service package to varying degrees of success. Learning how to find someone you can trust to get the job done as well as fit the client's style was a very important part of the process.

I shut the agency down in 2018 due to health problems that led to severe burnout, even though we were really starting to gain traction in the market.

Health is always priority number one.

### Internship at TIVIT

```
07-08-2015 - 07-08-2016
```

Front-end developer for a B2B route planning and vehicle tracking system. I worked on the transition from php and AngularJs to Angular 2, in an effort to update the legacy code the project contained.

`We used Angular, AngularJs and PHP`

### Designer at PrintLabor

```
15-02-2011 - 15-12-2011
```

PrintLabor was a graphic-design agency in Rio de Janeiro. I helped open the second location and worked as lead designer, responsible for creating and approving the clients designs before they went to print. I also enabled them to offer web-design services as well, and was responsible for creating and implementing the designs.
